  - any fun insights? do ape holders also hold azuki or cool cats etc

For fun want to building sth like 
A Crypto Paycheck App
- with a simplest UI
- just for my boss so that he doesn't have to care when to send a paycheck 
    - automatically by using Chainlink Keepers

- ETH or SOL 




How long will it take to build a crypto paycheck app on solana with no knowledge on solana nor Rust
