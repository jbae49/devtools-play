### What's all about those dev tools 


Want to try out sth like 
- get nft info given the wallet address 
  - any fun insights? do ape holders also hold azuki or cool cats etc 
  
  
- given address, what protocols one has used so far?
  - if i want to make some comments about a certain protocol one might want to know whether i really have used it or not
  
  
- mev


- `cl.py` and `retry.py` is for 
    * downloading an entire NFT collection (around 9k images) from IPFS and uploading to google drive 


- paymesol 
    * ethereum
    * solana


A Crypto Paycheck App
- with a simplest UI
- just for my boss so that he doesn't have to care when to send a paycheck 
    - automatically by using Chainlink Keepers

- ETH or SOL 




How long will it take to build a crypto paycheck app on solana with no knowledge on solana nor Rust
