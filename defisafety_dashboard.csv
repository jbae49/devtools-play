It is explained in this document.', 'Four different audits have taken place in the past year, all of which are public, and have been published pre-mainnet launch.\n\xa0\n\xa0- The Zokyo audit found that BadgerDAO was very secure and well-written. The only issue that was underlined in the report was an informational language usage flag in the Badger code. Essentially, they use internal functions for modifier roles in some of their contracts, but they should just use modifiers instead. Overall, Zokyo found nothing that could actively pose a risk to the smart contracts\' integrity.\n\xa0\n\xa0- The Haechi audit found several minor and informational issues for the Badger team to work on. Unfortunately, there is no indication as to what the team did to resolve them. The underlined issues include a StakingReward bug where the contract\'s notifyRewardAmount() function would not check if it received rewards. This could lead to higher rewards for more active stakers, and potentially no rewards for others. In the same contract, another bug includes the notifyRewardAmount() function, where users could potentially be subjected to lower rewards rates. These are the most important findings, and all the other ones touch upon the language use and how it can be optimized.\n\xa0\n\xa0- The audit performed by Defi Yield did not find any issues. Rather, the report\'s only recommendations were to change the Controller and Sett contracts\' governance addresses to ""real"" governance addresses. This would imply that both of these contracts are not linked to the actual BadgerDAO governance addresses.\n\xa0\n\xa0- The Quantstamp audit report unveiled multiple issues. Several of them were of medium risk, and one of them was high risk. The issue is that most of them, including the high-risk one, are not yet resolved. The high risk issue comprises the fact that the Core Badger contract has unbounded trust in its peaks. Peaks, as defined by the Badger documentation, are any third-party integration within the protocol. The issue here is that these peak contracts are telling the Core contract how many tokens to redeem, mint, or burn without limits or any form of verification. This means that any malicious peak contract could completely mess with the overrall Badger token integrity. As this issue is yet unresolved, this poses a serious problem. All other mentionned issues are either medium, low, or of unknown risk, and mostly affect the Core contract.']",https://badger.wiki/addresses
